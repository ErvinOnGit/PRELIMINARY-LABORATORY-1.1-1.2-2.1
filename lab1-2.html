     <h1> The Best Movies According to Ervin </h1>
    <h2> My Top 10 Movies of all-time</h2> <hr/>

    <h3> Bloodhounds</h3>

    <p> The show is not as simple as you&#39;ve seen it from the trailer. It has a little bit more complicated stories and characters, but not too far off. It has brotherhood, bloody fight, mukbang, and above all, it&#39;s a fast pace show. The choreography of the fights in this show is also well done. It&#39;s just as good as another korean show from Netflix, My name. The martial arts or fight actions scenes in modern korean movies and tv shows are arguably better than any other action movies whether it&#39;s from hollywood, or outside of hollywood. They has more realistic fights. It&#39;s fast and furious literally. </p>

   <h3>The Walking Dead</h3>

   <p>As I mentioned in my review of the previous “Walking Dead” spinoff “Dead City” months back, AMC’s flagship franchise must bristle in the wake of “The Last of Us”’s success over at HBO. With their newest spinoff, “Daryl Dixon,” the comparisons become even more inescapable: Pair a grizzled, traumatized zombie killer with a young child fated to usher in humanity’s future and send them on a lonely, dangerous quest to take said child to sanctuary. That’s “The Last of Us,” and it’s also “Daryl Dixon,” to a degree where Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog ought to speed-dial their copyright lawyers.  </p>

   <h3>Dead Poets Society</h3>

   <p>“Dead Poets Society” is a collection of pious platitudes masquerading as a courageous stand in favor of something: doing your own thing, I think. It’s about an inspirational, unconventional English teacher and his students at “the best prep school in America” and how he challenges them to question conventional views by such techniques as standing on their desks. It is, of course, inevitable that the brilliant teacher will eventually be fired from the school, and when his students stood on their desks to protest his dismissal, I was so moved, I wanted to throw up.</p>

   <h3> Like Stars on Earth </h3>

   <p>Reviewers say &#39;Taare Zameen Par&#39; is acclaimed for its heartfelt depiction of dyslexia and the challenges faced by a young boy, Ishaan. The film is celebrated for its emotional resonance, standout performances by Darsheel Safary and Aamir Khan, and its impactful message on recognizing children&#39;s unique abilities. Critics highlight the direction, script, and music, though some note minor pacing and repetitive scenes. </p>

   <h3> The Hunt </h3>

   <p> Reviewers say &#39;The Hunt&#39; delves into social justice, mob mentality, and false accusations, highlighting the protagonist&#39;s ordeal after being wrongly accused. Mads Mikkelsen&#39;s performance is widely praised, and the film&#39;s emotional depth resonates with many. However, some criticize the plot&#39;s implausibility, particularly the community&#39;s swift acceptance of the accusation. Issues with pacing and believability in certain scenes are noted, though the movie remains impactful and thought-provoking for most viewers. </p>

   <h3> 3 Idiots </h3>

   <p> &#39;3 Idiots&#39; is celebrated for its humor, emotional depth, and critique of the Indian education system. Aamir Khan, R. Madhavan, and Sharman Joshi deliver strong performances, and the film&#39;s catchphrases resonate. However, it is criticized for a clich&#233;d plot, exaggerated scenes, and unrealistic elements. Some fault the character development and portrayal of suicide, claiming it oversimplifies complex issues. Despite these flaws, many find it entertaining and inspiring. </p>

   <h3> Whiplash </h3>

   <p> &#39;Whiplash&#39; delves into ambition and obsession through a toxic student-teacher dynamic. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons deliver intense performances, highlighting the sacrifices for artistic excellence. Critics praise the film&#39;s technical achievements but find its depiction of jazz and mentorship unrealistic. Concerns arise over the glorification of abusive behavior and the ambiguous moral resolution. Despite these issues, &#39;Whiplash&#39; is celebrated for its gripping narrative and jazz score. </p>

   <h3> 127 Hours </h3>

   <p> 127 Hours is the true story of mountain climber Aron Ralston&#39;s remarkable adventure to save himself after a fallen boulder crashes on his arm and traps him in an isolated canyon in Utah. Over the next five days Ralston examines his life and survives the elements to finally discover he has the courage and the wherewithal to extricate himself by any means necessary, scale a 65 foot wall and hike over eight miles before he can be rescued. Throughout his journey, Ralston recalls friends, lovers, family, and the two hikers he met before his accident. Will they be the last two people he ever had the chance to meet? </p>

   <h3> Like Father, Like Son </h3>

   <p> Would you choose your natural son, or the son you believed was yours after spending 6 years together? Kore-eda Hirokazu, the globally acclaimed director of &quot;Nobody Knows&quot;, &quot;Still Walking&quot; and &quot;I Wish&quot;, returns to the big screen with another family - a family thrown into torment after a phone call from the hospital where the son was born... Ryota has earned everything he has by his hard work, and believes nothing can stop him from pursuing his perfect life as a winner. Then one day, he and his wife, Midori, get an unexpected phone call from the hospital.  </p>

   <h3> Virgin Forest </h3>

   <p>Brillante Mendoza&#39;s &quot;Virgin Forest&quot; had the seeds to actually become an interesting watch. Beyond its sexual side, there was some meat here about abuse of power and abuse of nature. But alas, this film just had too much excesses at the end of the day. Too much sex, too much flair, too many characters, too many logical loopholes that it was barely watchable even at its most dramatic and most intimate moments. </p>
